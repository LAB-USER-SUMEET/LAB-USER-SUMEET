Hi I'm Sumeet Kumar and I pursuing my B. Tech from KIET Group of Institutins, Delhi(NCR) in ECE branch. 
My interests are in Front End Engineering and I love to create beautiful and performant products with delightful user experiences. 
Back in school, I designed and built a web application, NUSMods which solves a huge problem of class and timetable planning every semester.
My VoteStation website is built using a modern web technology stack - React, Redux, Webpack and is mobile-responsive." I'm interested in the Front End Engineer role specially in VLSI Domain.
